-Story:

A station on a planet englufed in a continous thunderstorm. The station uses lightning rods to capture
lightning from the storm and turn it into electricity. 3 massive power lines export the power to other
places on the planet and presumably places where it can be exported to other places in the galaxy.

-Gameplay:

This is a large map.
4v4 would be an absolute minimum.
8v8 would be good probobly.
12v12 would be excellent.

-Textures:

evillair : eX
Me : monitor textures
StarAndCircle from filterforge : generator lightning texture
Me : Skybox

(Very special thanks to evillair @ http://www.evillair.net/v2/
His texture pack was a huge part in this map so thanks to him!)

Note: I wrote the entire thunder.shader and thunder_lightningeffects.shader for the custom shaders in this map.
I did reference other map shaders and reference the q3 shader manual.
(Special thanks to simon @ http://www.simonoc.com/pages/articles.htm for teaching me terrain!)
